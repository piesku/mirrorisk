# Mirrorisk

Remember playing Risk when you were a kid? What if you could recreate the feeling of excitement mixed with the frustration when the dice roll a bunch of 1s? Look no further â€” _Mirrorisk_ is your (not) favorite board game, as a video game, playable right here in the browser. Except it's not exactly how you remember it.

Play the board game classic on a weirdly familiar yet uncomfortable map of the Mirrored Earth. West is East and East is West in this virtual cardboard rendition of the 1957 _Risk_. The rules have changed, too: the game ends the first time a player is eliminated, so be sure to protect the underdogs before you take the lead!

_Mirrorisk_ is a submission to [Gamedev.js 2021 Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2021/rate/1014384). The theme of the jam was _mirror_.

## Changelog

## Development

Risk is based on [Goodluck](https://github.com/piesku/goodluck), a hackable template for creating small and fast browser games.

### Running Locally

To run locally, install the dependencies and start the local dev server:

    npm install
    npm start

Then, open http://localhost:1234 in the browser.

In VS Code, Ctrl+Shift+B will show the available build tasks, including `npm start`, and F5 will open the browser.

### Building

To produce the optimized build, use the `Makefile` in `play/`.

    make -C play
